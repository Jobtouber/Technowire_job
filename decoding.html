            <p id="info">Programming languages can be divided into different categories. These categories provide
                software developers with various levels of abstraction and capabilities to develop software solutions.
                Machine code consists of instructions that are executed and understood by a computer processor. The code
                consists of binary digits and zeros that indicate actions and operations performed by the processor.
                Assembly languages are programming languages that provide a low level of abstraction between machine
                code and higher-level programming languages. Assembly languages use text symbols and abbreviations.
                Higher-level programming languages are languages designed to allow programmers to write code at a more
                abstract level. One example of a high-level programming language is Javascript. Fourth-generation
                languages, also known as 4GL, are programming languages designed to facilitate the development of
                software applications through higher levels of abstraction and automation. An example of a 4GL language
                is SQL. Object-oriented languages, also known as OOP languages, are programming languages that make it
                easier to design and maintain complex systems. An example of an object-oriented language is Python.</p>
