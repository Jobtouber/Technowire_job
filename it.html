                    <h4>Charles Babbage</h4>

                    <p>Charles Babbage was an English mathematician and inventor known as the "father of the computer." He
                    designed the Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer concept, and the Difference Engine, a
                    calculator, both pioneering devices in the history of computing. While his machines were never fully
                    built in his lifetime, his visionary ideas laid the foundation for modern computers. Babbage's work
                    continues to influence the field of computer science to this day.</p>

                    <h4>Ada Lovelace</h4>

                    <p>Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer recognized as the world's first computer
                    programmer. She made history by creating the world's first computer program for Charles Babbage's
                    Analytical Engine, a pioneering mechanical computer. Lovelace's work laid the foundation for modern
                    computer programming, and the language "Ada" is named in her honor.</p>

                    <h4>Grace Hopper</h4>

                    <p>Grace Hopper was a pioneering American computer scientist and naval officer. She played a crucial
                    role in the development of early computer systems and is credited with popularizing the term "bug"
                    for computer glitches. Hopper also helped create the first compiler, a fundamental tool for modern
                    software development. She was a trailblazer for women in technology and had a significant impact on
                    the field of computer science.</p>

                    <p>Gordon Moore is an American engineer and co-founder of Intel Corporation. He is best known for
                    "Moore's Law," a prediction he made in 1965 that the number of transistors on a computer chip would
                    double approximately every two years, leading to exponential increases in computing power. This
                    prediction has held true for several decades and has been a driving force in the semiconductor
                    industry's advancement. Moore's work has had a profound impact on modern technology and computing.</p>
